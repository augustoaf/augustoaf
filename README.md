Hi, Iâ€™m Augusto and here I usually upload code in .Net Core, Python and Java. All my codes are related to something that I'm learning (or already learned) for a quick reference.
The main purpose is to validate a concept, they are non-production code and also there is no intention to have a "state of the art" architecture.

The repositories are related to Apps developed for IoT, Edge Computing and Data engineering, but you may find other kind of apps as well.
