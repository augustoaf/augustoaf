Hi, Iâ€™m Augusto and here I usually upload code in .Net Core, Python and Java. All my codes are related to something that I'm learning (or already learned) and also something that I may use for a quick reference.
The main purpose I created these repositories is to have in just one place my own reference for interesting stuff I'm developing (or developed) to validate a concept (or whatever), they are not production code and the purpose is not to have a "state of the art" coding/architecture, although a few of them were written carefully :)

The repositories are mainly related to Apps developed for IoT and Edge Computing, but may have some other kind of Apps as well (e.g., ML and Computer Vision).
