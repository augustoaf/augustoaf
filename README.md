Hi, Iâ€™m Augusto and here I usually upload code in .Net Core, Python and Java. All my codes are related to something that I'm learning (or already learned) for a quick reference.
The main purpose I created these repositories is to have in just one place my own reference for interesting stuff I'm developing (or developed) to validate a concept, they are non-production code and the purpose is not to have a "state of the art" architecture, although a few of them were written carefully :)

The repositories are related to Apps developed for IoT, Edge Computing and data engineering, but you may find kind of Apps as well.
